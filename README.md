#My name is Zach Manta
####*And I know how to Git*

Some men are born knowing how to Git. And others *have Git thrust upon them.*

I was the latter type. I was born a wee lad in Hinsdale, Illinois. By the age of eight I had already completed
several intrepid tasks, including...

* Graduate first grade
* Graduate second grade
* Graduate third grade

But like they say, challenge is the womb of greatness. By the age of ten I was already a fount of wisdom,
poetry, epiphany. I said things like...

>Dad, I think my new motto in life is going to be "That's good enough."

And...

>Some people think dragons aren't real. But not me.

So the rest is history. After age 17 I attended the University of Southern California, got a degree
in Environmental Studies with a minor in psychology, spent a year in rural Uganda, and now here I am! At *The University
of Chicago*.

I even have a website where I write things and record a podcast! It's called [The MonkeyBuddha Diaries](https://monkeybuddhadiaries.com/).

Yup. That's my life as **Zach Manta**, a rootin' tootin' RStudio bootin' Cowboy!
